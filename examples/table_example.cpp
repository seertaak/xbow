// Below: define a "record", which is just a value type which in addition wraps
// Boost.Hana's BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT macro. This macro generates machinery
// which can be used to retrieve field names and types, as well as accessors that
// can read fields based on a compile-time integer (or string) representing the
// index (or name, respectively) of the field. Note that this dereferencing takes
// place in constant time. It's the same as accessing a struct member - it is *not*
// like accessing an item in a hash map (say). This reflective metadata is sufficient
// do the (ugly) Arrow C++ API raw lifting. For example, for the first field,
// an arrow Int32Builder will be used for writing data (what we call the *action*
// side, since the side-effect of an arrow being created is effected), and a
// Int32Array will be used for reading (the *views* side: here we take an regular
// arrow array or table, and wrap it with a range-v3 compatible range). For the
// "name" field, a arrow::StringBuilder and arrow::StringArray will be used, respectively.
// And so on.
